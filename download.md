Multiverse is an Open Source project licensed under the [Free BSD License](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core#license). There are 6 Plugins that make up the Multiverse plugin suite:

* Multiverse-Core
* Multiverse-Portals
* Multiverse-NetherPortals
* Multiverse-SignPortals
* Multiverse-Inventories (&beta;)

 The **only** one that is required is **Multiverse-Core**. There are several ways you can get a copy:

* You can download the source, and build it yourself. 
* We provide a [Jenkins Continuous Integration Server](http://ci.onarandombox.com/view/Multiverse/) that builds every commit.
* Our [project page](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/multiverse-core/) on dev.bukkit contains only stable releases.
