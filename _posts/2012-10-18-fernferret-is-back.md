Hello all!

It's been a while, but I'm finally back in action. I needed a little break to venture out into the world. I'll be working through all [250ish issues](https://github.com/multiverse/Multiverse-Core/issues) in the tracker in Core alone.

Here was the post I made on [an issue](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/issues/912#issuecomment-9473205) regarding where I've been. I've placed it below.

#### re: Lack of Communication

This is because a lot of the developers have other things going on right now. I can say a fair number of us have full time jobs, and I'm not going to lie to you, when I worked on Multiverse last summer/winter, it almost killed me. I would come home from work, hop on IRC, help users, and write code. It was a second full time job. I know the other developers supported as much or more than I did.

The problem comes when the support/feature requests start flowing in faster than we can handle them. For a while, I tried to keep up with all of them, but that was piled on top of the additional work. This is an open source project, we've taken our time and put together code for all to enjoy, fork, issue pull requests and so on. The problem with the community that has surrounded us is that we lack members like [@dumptruckman](http://www.github.com/dumptruckman) and [@main--](http://www.github.com/main--) who have stepped up out of the blue and helped with support, development and just being awesome. The Multiverse Team, has relatively high coding standards and our plugin is not simple. We get many more complaints than pull requests.

If the community of users would give back, updating documentation, commenting on issues etc, it'd make the project as a whole much easier to maintain.

Multiverse is not the easiest world management plugin, but it's definitely one of the most full featured. The big name it's drawn for itself (you have [@Rigby90](http://www.github.com/Rigby90) to thank for that, the father of MV) has also drawn the masses. The problem came when I saw how many people came into our IRC channel not having read manuals, not understanding basic concepts. I understand some people would prefer to just have the information spoon fed, rather than read through the docs, but the documentation is rather comprehensive, and if there's something wrong with it, it's a public wiki! Yay!

This is probably way too much information. If it's any consolation, I plan on coming back to the project soon (winter-ish time) after another project cools off.

Cheers,
