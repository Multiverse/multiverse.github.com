Alright. The time is almost here. After around **9 months** and a large break by myself, we're getting close to the 2.5 Awesome Build (our stable releases are called Awesome Builds). We're down to [5 tickets]() and once those are resolved, I'll put a timer on for 1 week. That means y'all have 1 week to test the 2.5 AB and find anything else that's wrong with it and Bukkit 1.4.X. Effectively all features that are under development have been pushed to 2.6. We're looking to perform **critical bug fixes** from here to 2.5. Even some minor "bugs" (most likely confusions) relating to permissions have been pushed to 2.6, but more on that below.

As for the future, we have a lot of things planned:
 - Bug Fixes!
 - [Permissions Revisit(Making permissions less confusing in MV)](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/issues/928)
 - [Per World Flying (We'll need testers for this!)](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/issues/440)
 - [Stuff with spawn eggs](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/issues/452)
 - [Better End handling](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/issues/248)

One of the hardest things to do is find testers willing to test in **non-production environments**. We need people to spin up servers and hit all of the functions hard. We're also always looking out for errors in our documentation, so hit us up on IRC about that if you find something!
