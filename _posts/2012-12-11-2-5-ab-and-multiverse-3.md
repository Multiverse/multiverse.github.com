Considering we're so behind schedule with releasing the 2.5 Awesome Build it seems like it's finally time to explain what is going on.

Over the past few months, [main--](https://github.com/main--) and [I](https://github.com/dumptruckman), have been the primary contributors to the Multiverse project.  We've been working, when we can and are willing, to fix bugs, add features, and close tickets.  [FernFerret](https://github.com/FernFerret) appeared for a little while to try to kick things in motion with hopes to release a new Awesome Build by a certain date.  At the time we had close to 250 open tickets on the Multiverse-Core issue tracker.  I personally saw to closing nearly 200+ of those, and in the processing spamming the crap out of my teammates email accounts!  However, the date he hoped to have it out by is long past and we're still not ready to release an Awesome Build.

So what happened?  I suppose our anticipated release date was a little too much to hope for.  Before we came up with our anticipated date, we still had a **significant** change to take care of that brought along a whole slew of new problems.  I guess that was a major part of our delay.  As things stand right now we have [these issues](https://github.com/multiverse/multiverse-core/issues?milestone=9&page=1&state=open) to take care of.  Some of them are very concerning but have been completely unable to reproduce in testing.  As such, I have yet to come up with a way to fix them and while they stand I don't feel comfortable releasing an Awesome Build.

Now, I'm sure all of you are wondering what the heck Multiverse 3 is.  For now, it's kind of just a code name for a complete code rewrite.  In the end it may still be called Multiverse 2, we'll see.  *But why are you rewriting the code, dumptruckman?*  Since I seem to have become the primary developer for the project, working with the existing code base is troublesome.  A complete rewrite will allow me to start fresh and completely understand the code which will in turn allow me to churn out more reliable updates in a shorter amount of time.  Along with the rewrite will come many improvements for the end user that I tend to offer in most of my personal plugins.  At the same time, I want Multiverse 3 to remain the same ol' world management plugin that everyone knows and loves.

Here are just a few things to look forward to in Multiverse 3:
 - Every property/config option will have in game help text to reduce the need to cosnult a wiki.
 - Along with this, the config files will have similar help text in comments.
 - There will be a world property defaults file that will be used when creating new worlds.
 - Almost all of the text in Multiverse 3 can be localized!
 - Better permission handling (if we don't take care of this sooner.)

Development on Multiverse has been admittedly slow lately.  If you're an experience Bukkit plugin developer and have any interest in contributing to a large well known project.  Please, let us know!
