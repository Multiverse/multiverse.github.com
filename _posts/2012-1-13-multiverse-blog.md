But guys!?! Why? Not another place to get info! We (I, [Eric Stokes](https://github.com/fernferret)) have decided to play around with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). This is neat because any of the MV devs can commit, write, yell or code on here. Anything you see here comes directly from the team.

This is where we'll talk about the new cool things we're doing with MV2.

For now, this site looks terrible. I'm working on prettifying it, but if any of you MV2 users are graphic designers and want to write us some sweet css, please send me an email: **fernferret at gmail**.
