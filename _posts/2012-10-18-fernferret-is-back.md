Hello all!

It's been a while, but I'm finally back in action. I needed a little break to venture out into the world. I'll be working through all [250ish issues](https://github.com/multiverse/Multiverse-Core/issues) in the tracker in Core alone.

Here was the post I made on [an issue]() regarding where I've been. I've placed it below.

#### re: Lack of Communication

This is because a lot of the developers have other things going on right now. I can say a fair number of us have full time jobs, and I'm not going to lie to you, when I worked on Multiverse last summer/winter, it almost killed me. I would come home from work, hop on IRC, help users, and write code. It was a second full time job. I know the other developers supported as much or more than I did.

The problem comes when the support/feature requests start flowing in faster than we can handle them. For a while, I tried to keep up with all of them, but that was piled on top of the additional work. This is an open source project, we've taken our time and put together code for all to enjoy, fork, issue pull requests and so on. The problem with the community that has surrounded us is that we lack members like @dumptruckman and @main-- who have stepped up out of the blue and helped with support, development and just being awesome. The Multiverse team, despite what a lot of people think, has relatively high coding standards, our plugin is not simple. We get very few pull request, and more complaints.

If the community of users would give back, updating documentation, commenting on issues etc, it'd make the project as a whole much easier to maintain.

As to your inquiry, I can't speak for the other developers, but I've been out of touch with the Minecraft community for about 4-6 months now. I got super burned out. It happens. Why haven't I left the project? Because I still love it. I just need some time to get away from people who simply demand and give nothing back. I understand that these folks are usually in the minority, but regardless if they are or not, they stand out like a sore thumb compared to the quite, kind and helpful folk.

>Its unsettling to have to use dev builds on my bigger plugins. All I ask is a little more clarity on whats going on. Sorry to have gone on a little tangent, but I am losing faith in an otherwise great plugin.

Why? Is a version number really so important? It's just a revision of software that we think will run well for most people. In theory, its features are documented, but sometimes we document ahead of release to try to keep up. I'm more curious here. My guess is you want the peace of mind that the software has been tested adequately. Honestly, we were (hopefully aren't anymore) one of the first plugins to have tests and mocking along with a successful user base of people who ran our software on non-production servers. This allows us to produce software with minimal bugs.

Multiverse is not the easiest world management plugin, but it's definitely one of the most full featured. The big name it's drawn for itself (you have @Rigby90 to thank for that, the father of MV) has also drawn the masses. The problem came when I saw how many people came into our IRC channel not having read manuals, not understanding basic concepts. I understand some people would prefer to just have the information spoon fed, rather than read through the docs, but the documentation is rather comprehensive, and if there's something wrong with it, it's a public wiki! Yay!

This is probably way too much information. If it's any consolation, I plan on coming back to the project soon (winter-ish time) after another project cools off.

Cheers,

EDIT: Whoops, forgot to mention how awesome @lithium3141 is. Seriously.

Sit tight.
